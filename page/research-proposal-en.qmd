## August 2025 Update
I recently gave a presentation on this same topic at a workshop during a study group meeting I co-host with my graduate school peers. I've included the slides from that presentation below.

## It All Starts with a Research Proposal
The first thing you do after entering graduate school (and joining a lab) is write a research proposal. While you technically write one for your graduate school application, it usually changes significantly for reasons I'll explain later.

The word "proposal" might make you think it's just a memo outlining your research schedule, outlook, and current thoughts. However, its primary purpose is to *propose* your research to others—to sell them on your idea. Therefore, a research proposal has a somewhat standard format, and the goal is to concisely convey the content and appeal of your research within that structure.

This article explains how to write a research proposal based on a template that has become somewhat standardized in my own lab, aimed at those who are just starting their research journey. For more detailed guidance, I recommend taking courses like "Methods in International Relations Research" offered at the undergraduate level, or graduate-level courses on academic writing and research methods.

### Proposals for Bachelor's and Master's Theses Evolve
I can't imagine anyone writing and submitting a master's thesis without making any changes to the research proposal they submitted for their graduate school entrance exam. In most cases, your direction and methodology will evolve as you present your work in seminars and classes and receive feedback and advice from others. Consequently, in graduate school (especially in a master's program), you might spend the first six months to a year writing and refining your research proposal. In other words, almost no one can create a perfect research plan at the very beginning of their thesis-writing process.

A research proposal for a bachelor's or master's thesis is a bit unique in that it is constantly being revised; you're always working on the "latest version of the research plan." However, the fundamental format and content of the proposal remain the same, so the advice in this article should still apply.

### The Purpose of a Research Proposal
As mentioned, a research proposal is a document for introducing your research to others. Your intended readers could be interviewers and examiners for admissions, your academic advisor and seminar peers, or professors you wish to consult. You need to convince this audience that your research is not only interesting but also feasible to complete. It's crucial to always write with the reader in mind.

Conversely, the proposal only needs to contain the information necessary to achieve that purpose. The various thoughts and knowledge in your head can be saved for the thesis itself. Specifically, a research proposal written in Japanese for a bachelor's or master's thesis should be about 3-4 A4 pages, excluding the reference list.[^11]

[^11]: As an aside, Japan's most famous public research fund, KAKENHI (Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research), also requires the submission of a research proposal document. The section on "Research Objectives, Methods, etc." in this document corresponds to the research proposal discussed here, and depending on the category, it is typically limited to 4-6 pages. ([JSPS Call for Proposals](https://www.jsps.go.jp/j-grantsinaid/03_keikaku/download.html))

Furthermore, the goal is not to introduce a vast amount of prior research. Of course, you need to touch upon and properly cite existing studies to show that you have familiarized yourself with the literature in the field. However, the most important thing is to introduce *your own research*. Therefore, you should consciously allocate more space to explaining your own theory and hypothesis rather than detailing the work of others. Simply put, you don't need to generously introduce other people's research.

### It Also Becomes the Introduction to Your Thesis
A research proposal concisely summarizes the core information of your study. This is equivalent to the abstract in a research paper, and for a bachelor's or master's thesis, it corresponds to the introduction chapter. Therefore, the research proposal you continuously revise can ultimately be adapted almost directly into the introduction of your thesis. It is important that readers of your thesis can get a general idea of your research and find it interesting just by reading the introduction.

However, note that the research proposal does not become the introduction word-for-word. There are things you cannot write at the proposal stage (like the results and implications of your research), and the introduction chapter will also need a section outlining the structure of the thesis.

## What's in a Research Proposal
While the order and content may vary slightly depending on the person or lab, the information that should be in a research proposal is largely the same.[^1] You can click on each item to jump to that section.

[^1]: Phillips and Pugh (2025) categorize research into three broad types: "exploratory research," "testing-out research," and "problem-solving research." They suggest that testing-out research is suitable for doctoral dissertations. Therefore, this page proposes a research proposal structure based on the assumption that you will be conducting testing-out research.

1.  [A Catchy Title](#a-catchy-title)
2.  [The Research Question](#the-research-question)
3.  [Research Background](#research-background)
4.  [Significance of the Research](#significance-of-the-research)
5.  [Theory and Hypothesis](#theory-and-hypothesis)
6.  [Research Method (Research Design)](#research-method-research-design)
7.  [Reference List](#reference-list)

Let's break each one down.

### A Catchy Title
Unless otherwise specified, the title of your research proposal should not be "Research Proposal." As mentioned, a proposal is not a personal memo or a notebook; it's a pitch to sell your research to others. Your presentation begins with the title.

The title of your proposal should communicate the overall content and argument of your paper. Ideally, it should be a title that you could use for your final thesis. You can use a subtitle if needed; try to come up with a great title that effectively conveys your research in conjunction with the main title. By the way, while English papers often use a colon (:) to separate the main title and subtitle, Japanese papers often enclose the subtitle with em dashes (—) (at least, that's how I was taught).

### The Research Question
The research question is **the core inquiry that your study aims to answer**. The underlying premise is that research begins with a question and seeks to answer it. In fact, if you recall some papers you've read recently (or re-read their abstracts), you'll likely find that they state the research question at the outset.

Framing your research question as a "puzzle" can make it easier to formulate. A puzzle is **a contradiction that exists between existing knowledge and an actual social phenomenon**. Resolving this puzzle is one of the main objectives of research. A key starting point in social science research is to ask why a contradiction arises when a social phenomenon goes against the knowledge (common sense, consensus in prior research, intuition) that academia and society have produced. I won't go into further detail on how to formulate a research question here (for more, please refer to various textbooks). The important thing is to consistently remember that research is the pursuit of an answer to a question.

There are several styles of research questions. A common distinction is between **Why Questions** and **How Questions**. The former focuses on the causal relationship between an independent variable (cause) and a dependent variable (effect), aiming to build a theory that identifies the independent variable itself or the causal mechanism. A classic example is, "Why don't democratic states go to war with each other?" On the other hand, a How Question is used to analyze and describe the current situation or to detail a process. An example might be, "How did Japan become a super-aged society?"

Some labs or departments may not accept research based on How Questions or policy-proposal-style papers as master's theses. This depends entirely on your supervisor's policy, so be sure to confirm with them.

### Research Background
If your research subject is a specific region or a social phenomenon that is not widely known, it may be beneficial to provide some background information. In such cases, using specific examples to explain the research background can deepen the reader's understanding.

However, be mindful of the following: **provide the background explanation *after* presenting the research question**. I sometimes see proposals or presentations that offer a (lengthy) introduction to a case study before stating the question, but this approach is not reader-friendly. While it's true that in your own thought process, you likely came up with the research question while investigating a specific case, readers will better understand the specific background with the question already in mind. Just as good writing presents the conclusion first, the research background should follow the question.

### Significance of the Research
The significance of the research refers to **the contribution your study will make to academia and society**. It can be broadly divided into academic significance and policy (or social) significance. This is where you explain (1) why it is necessary to answer this question, (2) the shortcomings of previous research or existing social practices, and (3) the novelty and appeal of your research.

### Theory and Hypothesis
In this section, you present the theory you believe is valid for your research and the testable hypothesis derived from it. To put it very simply,[^2] a **theory** is a collection of causal relationships, mechanisms, and assumptions about causes and effects. A **hypothesis**, on the other hand, is an observable and concrete phenomenon that should logically follow if the theory is correct.

[^2]: In graduate school, you'll have time to contemplate "What is a theory?" or "What is a hypothesis?" (and furthermore, "What is scientific research?"). However, I cannot possibly cover that here. "Causal Inference in Social Science" (原因を推論する), which I've listed as a recommended book, also deals with these points.

One of the ultimate goals of science might be to explain a broader range of phenomena with a more general theory. Mainstream theories in international relations (such as realism or liberalism) aim to provide comprehensive explanations for phenomena related to interactions between states (war, peace, cooperation, etc.) and their causes. In that sense, your research is expected to advocate for the most explanatory and comprehensive theory currently available in your field.[^3] This could be a new theory you've developed by improving upon existing ones, or it could be a determination of which of the previously proposed theories is the most valid.

[^3]: As mentioned earlier, this is what is required for "testing-out research." The requirements may differ for other types of research.

Therefore, in this chapter, you need to clarify four points: (1) an explanation of the theory you are proposing or supporting, (2) the reasons why you believe this theory is valid, (3) why other theories are insufficient, and (4) the hypothesis that should be observable if your theory is correct. A hypothesis is, in other words, a prediction about the real world. Proposing a hypothesis that cannot be predicted by other theories but can be by yours is crucial for validating your theory. The theory you propose, from which you derive a hypothesis that is then verified, is guaranteed to be correct until it is falsified by someone else's research later on. In this sense, research can be seen as a process of refining theories.

Here are a few additional points about hypotheses. First, it is desirable for a hypothesis to have a structure like this: "As the value of the independent variable increases (or decreases), the value of the dependent variable increases (or decreases)." This format, which describes the change in the dependent variable in response to a change in the independent variable, is required because theory primarily deals with causal relationships between causes and effects.[^4] However, this may not apply if you are presenting a limited hypothesis about a specific case rather than a generalized theory.

[^4]: On this point, if you consider the relationship between the independent and dependent variables to be deterministic, you would phrase it as "when X happens, Y will happen." If you consider it probabilistic, you would say "when X happens, Y is more likely to happen" or "there is a tendency for Y."

Second, you may formulate multiple hypotheses. The reasons vary, but it is generally either (1) to present competing hypotheses/theories and argue for the validity of your proposed theory by showing that only the one you support is verified, or (2) to present all the several hypotheses that can be derived from your proposed theory. In case (1), you would distinguish the hypotheses you do not support by calling them "alternative hypotheses" and then reject them through testing to assert the correctness of your own hypothesis. In case (2), you need to explain the relationship between the hypotheses. Especially if different independent variables are set, you should explain which one is most important and what the relationships are between them. Of course, it is not always necessary to have multiple hypotheses; you should be flexible depending on the ease of testing and the content of your argument.[^5]

[^5]: I feel that papers using quantitative analysis or mathematical models as their methodology tend to have more hypotheses (3, 4, or more). This is likely because statistical analysis makes it easy to handle multiple models at once. Even in this case, a discussion of the relationships between the hypotheses and the magnitude of the causal effects is still necessary.

Finally, any theory should have its limits as well as its validity. The scope of a theory's explanatory power is called its **scope conditions**, and you should explain this scope when presenting the theory. If you are aware of these conditions at the proposal stage, it's good to include them in the research proposal. This applies, for example, when certain assumptions are attached to the theory. By clarifying the scope of the theory, you can make the range of social phenomena your research covers and the generalizability of your theory clear. On the other hand, limitations discovered during the verification process or as a result of your discussion should be written in the concluding chapter of your thesis.

### Research Method (Research Design)
The theory and hypothesis presented in the previous section must be tested using scientific methods. This chapter explains the method of verification. In the research design chapter, you should explain the following elements: (1) how the independent and dependent variables of the hypothesis will be **operationalized**, (2) what **data** you will use for testing, and (3) what **methodology** you will use for testing.

First, hypotheses are usually written in general terms at this stage. Independent and dependent variables are expressed in words like "degree of democracy," "state power," or "parliamentary speech." The process of redefining these concepts with criteria that can actually be observed is called "operationalization." The degree of democracy can be observed by whether elections are held or if freedom of the press is guaranteed. State power might be observed through military spending (in U.S. dollars). Parliamentary speech needs to be defined by explaining which parliament and which specific words' occurrences are being examined. If these operationalizations are based on definitions from prior research, you should state that explicitly. Examples include using Polity 5 for the degree of democracy or the Correlates of War's National Material Capability for state power.

Second, list all the data you will use for your analysis. This applies to both quantitative and qualitative analysis. Data includes not only numerical data like the above but also parliamentary records, newspapers, politicians' statements, and official documents. Explaining what data you plan to use for verification is essential as it directly relates to the feasibility and validity of your research. (Furthermore, writing down the data you know of is a good idea because someone might be able to tell you if better data exists in the field.) If you are conducting a quantitative analysis, you also need to explain the period and region covered by the data. If the region or period is limited due to data availability, you should explain whether this affects your analysis. If you are conducting a case study, you must state the reason for your case selection.

Third, it is good practice to specify the methodology you will use. For quantitative analysis, name the model you will use (e.g., linear regression analysis, survival analysis, quantitative text analysis). For qualitative analysis, also name the method (e.g., process tracing, comparative case study, congruence analysis). You will also need to explain why you are using that particular methodology. Especially if you are using a method that is not commonly employed in your field, you must argue its advantages over more common methods, or you might get comments like, "Couldn't you just run a regression analysis?" In this sense, it is important to study the methodological features and advantages of each method thoroughly.

Note that how to create and write a research design is often detailed in textbooks on various methodologies. They are somewhat standardized, clearly defining what should be written. Therefore, following a textbook is probably the best approach.

### Reference List
All literature cited in the text must be included in the reference list without omission. This is, needless to say, to prevent plagiarism, and you may need to cite bibliographic information correctly in a unified style. I will not go into detail on citation methods here, so please check various textbooks and resources.

I have also created a page summarizing how to cite in APA style. It might be helpful.

-   [How to Cite in APA Style](/page/apa-style.qmd)

However, I will briefly explain some of the most frequently asked and important questions.

-   References are generally listed in alphabetical order by the author's family name.
    -   In other fields, they may be numbered 1, 2, ... in order of citation.
-   Japanese and English literature are often listed separately.
-   A hanging indent is often used for the reference list to improve readability.
    -   Here's [how to create a hanging indent in MS Word (Microsoft)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-hanging-indent-in-word-7bdfb86a-c714-41a8-ac7a-3782a91ccad5).
-   Even if you use a method that includes full bibliographic information in footnotes, it is better to provide a separate reference list.
    -   Of course, this does not apply to the body of the thesis itself.

Separately, you might create a list of literature that you have referred to for study or plan to read, even if not cited (this is limited to seminar presentation materials or consultation documents; it is not permissible in grant applications). **You may provide this as a separate list from the reference list.** Presenting how much prior research you have reviewed in the field can make it easier for others to give you advice and comments.
